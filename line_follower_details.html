                              <p>During my time in high school, our teachers assigned us the task of building a line follower robot. This project served as our exam project and came right after our Arduino lessons. As a result, we formed groups, and my best friend, Onur Mutlu, and I began conducting research and exploring existing projects related to line followers. Through our efforts, we managed to program a line follower, although its performance was not exceptional. Nevertheless, we were proud of our accomplishment, as it demonstrated our determination and the skills we had acquired.</p>
                              <p>Two or three weeks later, my friend Onur stumbled upon a PID-controlled line follower and proposed that we should give it a try. As high school students, I had never heard of PID before, and when I searched online, I came across numerous formulas that seemed complex and difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, we uploaded the code and conducted a test. To our astonishment, the results were remarkable. The line follower flawlessly followed the line, and this experience helped us grasp the principles of PID control. It was a significant breakthrough in our understanding of advanced robotics concepts.</p>
                              <h2>Improving</h2>
                              <p>After witnessing the effectiveness of PID control, we decided to participate in line follower robot competitions. In these competitions, the organizers provided us with the details of the track, and we recreated the same track in our high school for testing purposes. Despite our lack of experience, we put in tremendous effort and managed to complete the line follower track. We then focused on improving the speed of our robot and eagerly joined the competitions. It was an exhilarating experience, and my line follower successfully completed the track without any mistakes. However, it didn't secure a position in the top five. Nevertheless, the journey was incredibly rewarding, and I learned valuable lessons along the way.</p>
							  <p>Here are some specs of our line follower.</p>
                              <ul>
							    <li>QTR8-a line follower sensor, Arduino nano, MZ-80 object sensor and a motor driver used.</li>
                                <li>Decent speed with precise and accurate line following capabilities.</li>
                                <li>Designed and programmed by high school students.</li>
