                <h3 class="ds-officename">İkartu Dinamik</h3>
                <span class="ds-department">Intern</span>
                <p>Ikartu is a Research and Development company specializing in virtual reality and the metaverse. Additionally, they have previously undertaken simulation projects. This is why they occasionally utilize microcontrollers to simulate real-life scenarios, such as ESP boards. During our initial meeting, they inquired about my interests, to which I expressed a desire to work with microcontrollers. In response, they recommended that I learn about ESP boards. Not only are they cost-effective, but they also offer faster performance compared to most other microcontrollers. Furthermore, they come equipped with an integrated onboard WI-FI + Bluetooth combo, making them even more versatile.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>After these initial discussions, I was assigned a project to learn about the ESP 12F board. The task involved connecting the ESP 12F module with an MPU6050 gyro + accelerometer sensor and transmitting the collected data to a Unity simulation through UDP communication. As a starting point, I designed a PCB board as requested, which turned out to be visually impressive. However, I couldn't test it because it was only a prototype that needed to be purchased from China. Instead, I decided to build the circuit on a breadboard. Surprisingly, everything worked perfectly. The board successfully connected to my Wi-Fi, read the values from the MPU6050 sensor, and transmitted them to the Unity program I had developed. Ultimately, the project was successfully completed. </li>
                  <li>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing ESP boards, and I believe it has been a significant learning opportunity for me. ESP boards hold great importance due to their affordability, speed, compact size, utility, and user-friendly nature. They are widely employed in various Internet of Things (IoT) projects. This experience has instilled confidence in my ability to undertake similar endeavors in the future.</li>

                <span class="ds-department">Intern</span>
                <p>This internship was a tremendous learning experience for me. In the initial days, we engaged in some manual tasks. However, my friend and I noticed that they were facing issues with Arduino boards. We took the initiative to offer our assistance in programming these Arduinos. As a result, we successfully completed two projects over a period of six months. The first project involved developing an ABS brake simulation for technical high school students, while the second project focused on creating a sensor education kit for universities.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the ABS brake simulation project, we utilized motors that needed to be controlled with Arduino in order to simulate an ABS brake system.</li>
                  <li>In the sensor education kit project, we designed a comprehensive system consisting of 36 sensors distributed across 4 different boards. Additionally, we developed a main machine that displayed the outputs from these sensors. My friend and I took the responsibility of programming each sensor and designing the four sensor boards.</li>

                <p>This internship became the pivotal point where I began my journey in programming. While still in high school, I had the opportunity to participate in summer internships, and my school arranged for me to join this particular company. Upon arrival, they asked me about my interests, and I expressed my desire to learn programming. One of the engineers suggested that I start by learning Python and assigned me tasks to enhance my understanding. Initially, the tasks focused on sorting algorithms, but as I progressed, I delved into socket programming and even developed a messaging app. This experience laid the foundation for my programming skills and ignited my passion for the field. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I also learned PowerShell during that time, specifically for scripting Python applications.</li>
                  <li>Python consumed most of my time during this internship as I dedicated myself to learning its fundamentals. I completed numerous tasks aimed at grasping the basics of programming.</li>
                  <li>After acquiring proficiency in Python, I set out to develop a messaging application. To achieve this, I focused on learning how to establish TCP servers and clients.</li>
